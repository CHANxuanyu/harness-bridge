# Handoff

## Current state (2026-10-06, end of day)

- **Both bounded real smoke levels passed on this Mac:** T3 (GLM operator → bridge →
  Claude Code) and T4 single-run (local Codex session, supervisor model `gpt-6-astra` per
  local turn-context metadata → bridge → Claude Code → review → SUCCEEDED). One initial
  attempt each, zero repairs, all gates satisfied, live gates closed after each run.
  Evidence: `docs/LOCAL_SMOKE_HANDOFF.md` (T3) and `docs/T4_SMOKE_RESULT.md` (T4); matrix
  rows in `docs/VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`.
- **Not verified — do not assume:** live repair/`--resume`, real interruption recovery,
  live timeout enforcement, long/multi-task behaviour, T5 comparative evaluation, and any
  claim that delegating through the bridge is cheaper or better than direct Opus use.
  Subscription quota remaining: unknown.
- **Repository:** `CHANxuanyu/harness-bridge`, **public** by the user's explicit choice
  (do not change visibility; no license added yet). Working branch
  `local/glm-macos-validation` (contains the cloud delivery head `fcbd21a`); pushed through
  `096238e`; later local commits are **not auto-pushed**.
- **Live-gate hygiene:** the global default state dir was never live-enabled; the T3/T4 test
  state dirs had live on only for their single runs and were switched off afterwards. Raw
  logs, run databases, review files and worktrees for both runs stay **outside** the
  repository; only redacted summaries are committed.
- **Offline regression samples:** field-level redacted stream logs from both runs live in
  `tests/fixtures/claude_stream_live/` (see its PROVENANCE.json) with parser tests in
  `tests/contracts/test_claude_adapter_live.py`. No model was invoked to build them.
- For future live runs: reuse the checklist in `docs/LOCAL_HANDOFF.md` §2 and the materials
  in `qa/local/`; confirm per-flag evidence and the config opt-in in a fresh isolated state
  dir every time.

## Known issues

- Process-group tests need the explicit "steady state" handshake: killing the runner before
  the fake executor writes its first line makes the executor die of a broken pipe
  (legitimate, but a different path). Tests wait for 2 live group members first.
- Git filters configured in the shared `.git/config` can run during snapshots (documented in
  SECURITY.md); ignored files are outside the observed scope.
- T4 procedural deviation (recorded, closed): one initial read-only `hbridge --help` omitted
  `--state-dir`; every stateful command used the explicit isolated test state dir.
- Permission denials seen in the live runs are permission-layer events (scoped tool
  allowance), not OS-sandbox isolation and not executor failures.
- ~~macOS behaviour (no `/proc`, `ps` fallbacks) is untested~~ — verified 2026-10-06 (full
  suite + 28 targeted tests; macOS rows in `docs/VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`).
- `--max-turns` on CLI 2.1.291: absent from `--help`, accepted in a real minimal call
  (parse-level). Enforcement beyond acceptance remains unproven; per-flag confirmation is
  still required by the live preflight.

## Constraints still in force

- Development model for the bridge itself: `claude-opus-5-5`; no extra model API budget.
- Runtime mode remains `mock` unless locally and explicitly authorized per run.
- Never add `--bare` or `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; never weaken the live gate; never
  convert failing tests into skips.

## History (cloud delivery, 2026-10-06 — superseded)

- Developed in a Claude Code Cloud session through `aeea786` (code) plus docs-only head
  `fcbd21a`; the offline suite and both demos were verified there and from a clone of an
  exported bundle. Working branch at the time: `claude/new-repo-plan-dn1eac`.
- Delivery was a self-contained git bundle because the user's then-authorization to make the
  repository private could not be executed with the cloud session's GitHub tooling and
  pushing to a public repo was not authorized at that time. **Superseded later the same
  day:** the repository stays public by the user's explicit choice and the branches are
  pushed.

## Next bounded work (each needs explicit user authorization before any real call)

1. Live repair / `--resume` verification: one controlled repair, max_attempts 2, record
   whether the session id is preserved.
2. Interruption / timeout behaviour with a live executor (SIGTERM to the runner, wall
   timeout) — offline tests exist; live behaviour does not.
3. T5 evaluation per `docs/EVALUATION_PLAN.md` — the only place where "cheaper/better than
   direct Opus" can ever be answered.
4. No-model engineering items: `docs/BACKLOG.md`.
